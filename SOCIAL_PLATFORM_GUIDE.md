## Database Setup

### Step 1: Run Community Schema (REQUIRED FIRST)

1. Open `src/database/community-schema.sql`
2. Go to your Supabase SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire file
4. Run the query

This creates:
- `user_profiles` - User information
- `private_messages` - Private messaging
- `comments` - Public comments
- `comment_votes` - Voting system
- `user_connections` - Follow/follower relationships

### Step 2: Run Social Schema (REQUIRED SECOND)

1. Open `src/database/social-schema.sql`
2. Go to your Supabase SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire file
4. Run the query

This creates:
- `posts` - Social feed posts
- `post_likes` - Post likes
- `post_shares` - Post shares
- `notifications` - Notification system
- `user_activity` - Activity tracking

**IMPORTANT**: Run community-schema.sql BEFORE social-schema.sql!
